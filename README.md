# 💫 About Me:
I have been a professional software engineer since 2003, and I've been a PHP full-stack web developer for over seven years. I'm experienced in Laravel, JavaScript, Vue.js, React.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind, MySQL, Redis, Git, and Docker.
I always try to use Clean Code, OOP, and design patterns in my projects.
I'm a one-man army in a startup project and a good team member in a team project.
